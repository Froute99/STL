The class template span describes an object that
can refer to a contiguous sequence of objects with
the first element of the sequence at position zero.
A span can either have a static extent, in which case
the number of elements in the sequence is known
at compile-time and encoded in the type, or
a dynamic extent.

If a span has dynamic extent a typical implementation
holds two members: a pointer to T and a size.
A span with static extent may have only one member:
a pointer to T.
